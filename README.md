#Space Race

##Project Description

Space Race is a skills-based game where you must navigate a spacecraft around a group of obstacles in order to capture an objective and return to base in the quickest time possible.

###What problem does it solve?

I'd like a game that I can pick up quickly but is challenging enough so that I can take my mind off the stress from the day.

###Who has this problem?

John is 25 years old. He is a fan of arcade games and science fiction novels. John needs a game that he can pick up quickly, is challenging enough to create a useful diversion and is addicting enough to make him come back to play day after day. He wants to play in the morning, at his favorite coffee shop, to clear his head before he heads into work.

###Context:

John steps into the coffee shop. It is 5:45am. He is tired. He takes a seat, coffee in hand, and takes out his laptop. He is sick of his usual websites, like Facebook and Reddit, and decides he wants to play a fun quick game. He remembers that he got the high score on level one of Space Race. He quickly navigates to the game's home screen and logs in. He notices his friend has beaten his score and John delves into the game to see if he can retake the leaderboard.

###How does the game solve this problem?

The game is quick to pickup and play without much of a learning curve but is challenging to master.

###What was the most valuable piece of customer feedback?

The most valuable piece of customer feedback was in regards to the leaderboards table. They wanted to see the leaderboards modal fleshed out a little more. This meant adding buttons that would allow the user to filter the leaderboards by level. In addition, if logged in, the table's rows corresponding to the player logged in would be highlighted.

###What was the biggest challenge to overcome?

The first challenge to overcome was adapting to using Git/GitHub in a team environment. It took a little bit to get into a flow so that we wouldn't waste too much time figuring out merge conflicts or anything else that could go wrong with Git/GitHib. We solved this by going the route of pair programming. By doing this we saved time that we put towards developing the game.

The second was learning a new framework. We overcame this by digging through the documentation and experimenting with other people's code to learn new concepts and debug issues.

##Future Development - Version 2

###Mechanics

1. Build out a custom level builder that will make development of levels more efficient as well as give the players the ability to create their own custom levels.

2. Add sound effects.

3. Add in unlockables, such as different skins for the ship.

4. Add in the ability to pause the game with the keyboard.

5. Add in a fuel gauge in the HUD. This will add another level of complexity to the game. In addition to going as fast as you can to get the quickest time the player will now have to conserve fuel.

6. Add in a property that will calculate the ships weight as it changes throughout the level.

7. Add the ability to control the ship with the keyboard.

###Front-end

1. Add in a background video on the home page that will show of the gameplay.

2. Add in the ability to send custom objective complete messages. An example of this might be a message that informs the player if they have the new high score in the level.

3. Add in a profile page.

4. Make the application mobile-friendly.

5. Sync with the NASA API to get background images for the levels.
